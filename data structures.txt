data types:

numbers
	int
	long
	float
	double

char

string

data structure:
	a data structure is an entity which is build of one or more primitive data types in a specific order/hierarchy.
	it helps solve a problem efficiently by folowing a specific protocol to add, remove and access its contents.

basic data structures:
array(list):
	[1,2,3.0,"hello"]
	ordered - the order in which the items are appended will persist.
	dupes - OK
	operations:
		insert
		append
		remove
		iterate:

set:
	{1,2,3,"Hello"}
	unordered - order is not gauranteed
	dupes - NOK
	operations:
		add
		remove
		iterate

tupple:
		(1,2,3)
		ordered
		#point = (x,y)
		iterable
a = ((1,2), (2,3))
a[0][0]


dictionary:
	{"name": "John", "age": 27}
	unordered
	dupes - NOK
	oreations:
		insert
		remove
		iterate

[{'name':'asf','id':1,'type':'corp'},{},{}]



complex data structures:

linked list

doublely linked list

queue
